## The History of Coffee: How did Coffee reach India
Coffee reached India in the 17th century, mainly due to the efforts of a Sufi saint named Baba Budan. According to the legend, Baba Budan undertook a pilgrimage to Mecca in the 1600s. During his journey, he visited the port city of Mocha in Yemen, where he discovered the invigorating properties of coffee. Baba Budan smuggled seven coffee beans from Yemen by strapping them to his chest and returned to India.

Upon his return, Baba Budan planted the coffee beans in the hills of Karnataka, which later came to be known as the Baba Budan Giri Hills. The coffee plants thrived in the region's rich soil and suitable climate, marking the beginning of coffee cultivation in India.

Over the years, coffee cultivation spread to other parts of southern India, including the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh. Indian coffee gained recognition for its unique flavors and high-quality beans, eventually becoming an integral part of India's agricultural exports.
