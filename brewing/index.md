Coffee brewing can be broadly categorized into three primary methods: percolation, immersion, and percolative-immersion. Each method has its unique approach to extracting flavors and soluble compounds from coffee grounds resulting in different taste profiles and characteristics in the final cup of coffee.

1. **Percolation:** In percolation brewing, hot water passes through coffee grounds, typically driven by gravity or pressure. Examples include drip coffee makers, pour-over brewing, and espresso machines. Percolation brewing often results in a cleaner and brighter cup of coffee. 

2. **Immersion:** In immersion brewing, coffee grounds are soaked in hot water for a specific period, allowing the flavors and compounds to dissolve. Examples include French press, siphon, and cold brew. Immersion brewing often yields a richer and more full-bodied cup of coffee.

3. **Percolative-Immersion:** This hybrid method combines elements of both percolation and immersion brewing. Coffee grounds are immersed in hot water briefly, and then the water is forced through the grounds by pressure or gravity. Examples include the Moka pot and AeroPress. Percolative-immersion brewing can provide a balance between the strengths of both percolation and immersion methods.

4. **Espresso:** Technically, Espresso is a pressure-driven percolation method that forces hot water through finely ground coffee under high pressure, creating a concentrated beverage with a distinctive crema. However, given the variety and range within espresso, there is a separate section just for espresso.
