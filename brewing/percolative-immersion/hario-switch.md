## Brewing with a Hario Switch

The Hario Switch is a unique hybrid brewing device that combines the best elements of immersion and percolation brewing methods. This innovative coffee maker allows for greater control over the brewing process and produces a clean, balanced, and flavorful cup of coffee. Follow these steps to brew coffee with a Hario Switch:

### Equipment and Ingredients

- Hario Switch
- Hario V60 filters
- Fresh coffee beans
- Grinder
- Kettle
- Scale
- Timer
- Mug

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Preparation:**
   - Boil water to a temperature between 93째C and 96째C (200째F and 205째F).
   - Fold the Hario V60 filter along the seam and place it in the Hario Switch.

2. **Measure and Grind Coffee:**
   - Measure your desired amount of coffee, using a coffee-to-water ratio between 1:15 and 1:17.
   - Grind the coffee to a medium-coarse consistency, around 700 microns.

3. **Add Coffee Grounds and Rinse Filter:**
   - Place the coffee grounds into the Hario Switch, leveling the bed for even extraction.
   - Rinse the filter with hot water to eliminate any paper taste and preheat the brewing device.
   - Discard the rinse water and place the Hario Switch on a scale, taring the scale to zero.

4. **Bloom:**
   - Start the timer and gently pour 2-3 times the weight of coffee in water (e.g., 30-45g of water for 15g of coffee) over the grounds, making sure to wet all the coffee.
   - Allow the coffee to bloom for 30-45 seconds.

5. **Add Remaining Water and Engage Switch:**
   - After the bloom, pour the remaining water into the Hario Switch, up to the desired level or weight.
   - Engage the switch, keeping the brewing device in the immersion mode.

6. **Stir and Steep:**
   - Stir the coffee slurry gently to ensure all coffee grounds are saturated.
   - Allow the coffee to steep for 2 minutes.

7. **Disengage Switch and Drain:**
   - Disengage the switch, allowing the brewed coffee to pass through the filter and into the mug.
   - Wait for the coffee to drain completely, which should take around 1 to 1.5 minutes.

8. **Serve and Enjoy:**
   - Once the coffee has drained, remove the Hario Switch from the mug and enjoy the clean, balanced, and flavorful coffee it produces.

By following these steps and adjusting variables such as grind size (microns), coffee-to-water ratio, and steeping time, you can master brewing with a Hario Switch and enjoy a consistently delicious cup of coffee.
