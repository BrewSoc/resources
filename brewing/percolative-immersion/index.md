## Percolative-Immersion Brewing

Percolative-immersion brewing is a hybrid coffee brewing method that combines the principles of both percolation and immersion brewing. In this method, coffee grounds are partially or fully submerged in water, while water is also continuously added or allowed to flow through the coffee bed. This approach brings together the benefits of both brewing methods, resulting in a balanced and complex cup of coffee. Percolative-immersion brewing techniques include the Clever Dripper and the Hario Switch. Let's delve deeper into percolative-immersion brewing, its variables, and the brewing process.

### Variables

1. **Coffee-to-Water Ratio:** Similar to other brewing methods, the ratio of coffee to water determines the strength and flavor of the brew. A common starting point for percolative-immersion brewing is between 1:15 and 1:17 (e.g., 15-17g of water for every 1g of coffee). Adjust the ratio to your taste preferences.

2. **Grind Size:** Percolative-immersion brewing typically requires a medium grind size (around 700-900 microns), as it combines the characteristics of both percolation and immersion methods.

3. **Water Temperature:** Ideal water temperature for percolative-immersion brewing is between 93째C and 96째C (200째F and 205째F). Using water within this range ensures proper extraction without scalding the coffee grounds.

4. **Brewing Time:** The brewing time for percolative-immersion methods will vary based on the specific method being used. For example, the Clever Dripper typically has a brewing time of 3 to 4 minutes.

### Process

1. **Measure and Grind Coffee:** Measure your desired amount of coffee and grind it to the appropriate size for your chosen brewing method.

2. **Preheat and Prepare Brewing Device:** Preheat your brewing device and prepare it according to the specific method being used.

3. **Add Coffee Grounds and Water:** Place the coffee grounds in the brewing device and pour the hot water over them, ensuring an even saturation.

4. **Brew and Agitate:** Allow the coffee to brew for the recommended time based on the brewing method and grind size being used. Gently stir or agitate the coffee grounds during the brewing process to ensure even extraction.

5. **Initiate Percolation:** After the brewing time has elapsed, initiate the percolation phase by opening the valve or releasing the mechanism that allows the brewed coffee to flow through the coffee bed and into a separate container or mug.

6. **Serve and Enjoy:** Pour the brewed coffee into a mug or carafe, and enjoy the balanced and complex flavors produced by the percolative-immersion brewing method.

By understanding these variables and following the brewing process, you can create a consistent and delicious cup of coffee using percolative-immersion brewing methods.
