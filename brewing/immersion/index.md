## Immersion Brewing

Immersion brewing is a coffee brewing method where coffee grounds are fully submerged in water, allowing them to extract evenly and consistently throughout the brewing process. This method generally produces a full-bodied, rich, and balanced cup of coffee. Immersion brewing techniques include the French Press, AeroPress, and Siphon. Let's take a closer look at immersion brewing, its variables, and the brewing process.

### Variables

1. **Coffee-to-Water Ratio:** The ratio of coffee to water determines the strength and flavor of the brew. A common starting point for immersion brewing is between 1:15 and 1:17 (e.g., 15-17g of water for every 1g of coffee). Adjust the ratio to your taste preferences.

2. **Grind Size:** Immersion brewing typically requires a coarser grind size compared to percolation methods to prevent over-extraction. Grind size may vary depending on the specific brewing method being used. For example, French Press generally requires a coarser grind size (around 1000 microns) compared to AeroPress, which uses a finer grind (around 600-800 microns).

3. **Water Temperature:** Ideal water temperature for immersion brewing is between 93째C and 96째C (200째F and 205째F). Using water within this range ensures proper extraction without scalding the coffee grounds.

4. **Brewing Time:** Immersion brewing methods have varying brewing times based on the specific method and grind size being used. French Press typically has a brewing time of 4 minutes, while AeroPress can have a brewing time between 1 and 4 minutes, depending on the recipe.

### Process

1. **Measure and Grind Coffee:** Measure your desired amount of coffee and grind it to the appropriate size for your chosen brewing method.

2. **Preheat and Prepare Brewing Device:** Preheat your brewing device and prepare it according to the specific method being used.

3. **Add Coffee Grounds and Water:** Place the coffee grounds in the brewing device and pour the hot water over them, ensuring an even saturation.

4. **Stir or Agitate:** Stirring or agitation during the brewing process helps to ensure even extraction and saturation of the coffee grounds. The extent and timing of agitation will depend on the specific brewing method.

5. **Brew:** Allow the coffee to brew for the recommended time based on the brewing method and grind size being used.

6. **Separate Coffee Grounds and Brewed Coffee:** Once the brewing process is complete, the coffee grounds must be separated from the brewed coffee. The separation method varies based on the brewing device being used (e.g., pressing a plunger for French Press or pushing a plunger for AeroPress).

7. **Serve and Enjoy:** Pour the brewed coffee into a mug or carafe, and enjoy the full-bodied, rich, and balanced flavors produced by the immersion brewing method.

By understanding these variables and following the brewing process, you can create a consistent and delicious cup of coffee using immersion brewing methods.
