### Equipment and Ingredients

- French Press
- Fresh coffee beans

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Preparation:**
   - Boil water to a temperature between 93째C and 96째C (200째F and 205째F).

2. **Measure and Grind Coffee:**
   - Measure your desired amount of coffee, using a coffee-to-water ratio between 1:15 and 1:17.
   - Grind the coffee to a coarse consistency, around 900 microns.

3. **Add Coffee Grounds:**
   - Place the coffee grounds into the French Press.
   - Place the French Press on a scale and tare the scale to zero.

4. **Bloom:**
   - Start the timer and gently pour 2-3 times the weight of coffee in water (e.g., 30-45g of water for 15g of coffee) over the grounds, making sure to wet all the coffee.
   - Allow the coffee to bloom for 30 seconds.

5. **Add Remaining Water:**
   - After the bloom, pour the remaining water into the French Press, up to the desired level or weight.
   - Stir gently to ensure all coffee grounds are saturated.

6. **Steep:**
   - Place the plunger and lid on top of the French Press without pressing down.
   - Allow the coffee to steep for 4 minutes.

7. **Press and Pour:**
   - After 4 minutes, press the plunger down slowly and steadily, separating the coffee grounds from the liquid.
   - Immediately pour the brewed coffee into a mug to prevent over-extraction.

8. **Serve and Enjoy:**
   - Enjoy the rich, full-bodied flavors that the French Press brewing method offers.

By following these steps and adjusting variables such as grind size (microns), coffee-to-water ratio, and steeping time, you can master brewing with a French Press and enjoy a consistently delicious cup of coffee.
