## Brewing Coffee on a Percolation Brewer
Brewing coffee using a percolation brewer involves passing hot water through coffee grounds to extract flavors and soluble compounds. Percolation brewing methods, apart from [espresso](../espresso), focus on gravity-based extraction, resulting in a cleaner and brighter cup of coffee. In this overview, we'll explore the general process and variables associated with percolation brewing.

**Percolation Brewing Variables:**

1. **Grind Size:** Select the appropriate grind size for the specific percolation brewer being used. For most percolation methods, a medium to medium-coarse grind is suitable. The grind size impacts extraction rate and overall flavor profile.

2. **Coffee-to-Water Ratio:** Use a consistent coffee-to-water ratio to achieve the desired strength and balance. A common starting point is a 1:15 to 1:17 ratio (coffee to water) for percolation brewing methods.

3. **Water Temperature:** Aim for a water temperature between 195°F (91°C) and 205°F (96°C). Maintaining an optimal temperature ensures proper extraction and prevents over- or under-extraction.

4. **Brewing Time:** The brewing time varies depending on the method and grind size. Generally, percolation brewing methods take between 2 and 5 minutes. Monitor brewing time to achieve the desired flavor profile.

**Percolation Brewing Process:**
1. **Prepare Coffee Grounds**:  Measure the amount coffee you need to prepare your coffee, and then Select the appropriate grind size for the specific percolation brewer being used. Then, grind the coffee.

2. **Heat Water**: Heat water to the optimal temperature range of 91°C (195°F) to 96°C (205°F). In general, lighter roasted coffees require a hotter temperature than darker roasted coffees for achieving a similar extraction.

3. **Bloom:** Wet the coffee grounds with a small amount of water (2-3 times the amount of coffee grounds) to release trapped carbon dioxide, allowing for more even extraction. This process, called "blooming," usually takes about 30-45 seconds.

4. **Pouring Technique:** Pour hot water in a controlled manner over the coffee grounds until desired Coffee-to-Water ratio has been achieved. Some methods, like the Hario V60, require specific pouring techniques to ensure even extraction and optimal flavor. In general try to keep the flow around 4-6 ml/s.

5. **Extraction:** As hot water passes through the coffee grounds, it extracts flavors, oils, and other soluble compounds. The coffee liquid then drips into a carafe below.

By understanding the process and variables involved in percolation brewing, you can fine-tune each step to achieve a consistently delicious cup of coffee. Once you've mastered the general concepts, you can explore different percolation brewers, such as Hario V60, Moccamaster, and others, to experience the unique characteristics each method offers.
