- Timer
- Mug or carafe

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Preparation:**
   - Place the Kalita Wave dripper on a mug or carafe.
   - Insert the Kalita Wave filter into the dripper.
   - Boil water to a temperature between 195째F (91째C) and 205째F (96째C).

2. **Rinse the Filter:**
   - Pour hot water over the filter to rinse out any paper taste and to preheat the dripper and mug or carafe.
   - Discard the rinse water.

3. **Measure and Grind Coffee:**
   - Measure your desired amount of coffee, using a coffee-to-water ratio between 1:15 and 1:17.
   - Grind the coffee to a medium-coarse consistency.

4. **Add Coffee Grounds:**
   - Place the coffee grounds in the rinsed filter, leveling the bed for even extraction.
   - Place the entire setup on a scale and tare the scale to zero.

5. **Bloom:**
   - Start the timer and gently pour 2-3 times the weight of coffee in water (e.g., 30-45g of water for 15g of coffee) over the grounds, making sure to wet all the coffee.
   - Allow the coffee to bloom for 30-45 seconds.

6. **Pouring Technique:**
   - After the bloom, continue pouring water in a slow, steady, and controlled circular motion, starting from the center and moving outward.
   - Avoid pouring directly onto the filter.
   - Pause as needed to maintain a consistent water level, allowing the coffee to drip through the filter.

7. **Extraction:**
   - The total brew time should be between 3 and 4 minutes for a 10-12 oz (300-350 ml) cup of coffee.
   - Once the desired amount of brewed coffee has been collected, remove the Kalita Wave dripper and discard the filter with the spent coffee grounds.

8. **Serve and Enjoy:**
   - Give the brewed coffee a quick stir to ensure consistency and pour it into a cup.
   - Enjoy the balanced and rich flavors that the Kalita Wave brewing method offers.

By following these steps and adjusting variables such as grind size, coffee-to-water ratio, and pouring technique, you can master brewing with a Kalita Wave and enjoy a consistently delicious cup of coffee.
