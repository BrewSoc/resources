## Brewing with a Chemex

The Chemex is an elegant pour-over coffee brewing device known for its hourglass-shaped design and thick filters, which produce a clean, bright, and smooth cup of coffee. The Chemex is perfect for those who appreciate a refined and delicate flavor profile. Follow these steps to brew coffee with a Chemex:

### Equipment and Ingredients

- Chemex and filters
- Fresh coffee beans
- Grinder
- Kettle with a gooseneck spout
- Scale
- Timer
- Mug or carafe

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Preparation:**
   - Boil water to a temperature between 93째C and 96째C (200째F and 205째F).
   - Place the Chemex filter in the brewer with the three-layered side against the pouring spout.

2. **Measure and Grind Coffee:**
   - Measure your desired amount of coffee, using a coffee-to-water ratio between 1:15 and 1:17.
   - Grind the coffee to a medium-coarse consistency, around 800 microns.

3. **Rinse Filter and Add Coffee Grounds:**
   - Pour hot water through the filter to rinse it and preheat the brewing device.
   - Discard the rinse water and place the Chemex on a scale, taring the scale to zero.
   - Add the coffee grounds to the filter, leveling the bed for even extraction.

4. **Bloom:**
   - Start the timer and gently pour 2-3 times the weight of coffee in water (e.g., 30-45g of water for 15g of coffee) over the grounds, making sure to wet all the coffee.
   - Allow the coffee to bloom for 30-45 seconds.

5. **Pour Remaining Water:**
   - After the bloom, slowly pour the remaining water in a steady spiral motion, starting at the center and working outward.
   - Keep the water level consistent throughout the brewing process, pouring in stages as needed.
   - Aim for a total brewing time of around 4 to 5 minutes.

6. **Serve and Enjoy:**
   - Once the water has passed through the coffee grounds and the brewing process is complete, remove the Chemex filter and dispose of the coffee grounds.
   - Enjoy the clean, bright, and smooth cup of coffee produced by the Chemex brewing method.

By following these steps and adjusting variables such as grind size (microns), coffee-to-water ratio, and pouring technique, you can master brewing with a Chemex and enjoy a consistently delicious cup of coffee.
